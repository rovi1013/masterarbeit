Climate and Energy Scenarios

Scenarios are structured descriptions of possible futures. They are not predictions but tools for analysis.

Energy and climate scenarios often vary assumptions about:
- Economic growth
- Population development
- Technology adoption
- Climate and energy policies

Scenarios help compare pathways with different temperature outcomes and energy system transformations.
