Drivers of Climate Change

The dominant driver of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations caused by human activities.

Major emission sources include:
- Burning of fossil fuels for electricity and heat
- Transport using oil-based fuels
- Industrial processes such as cement production
- Agriculture, especially livestock and fertilizer use

Land-use change, such as deforestation, reduces natural carbon sinks.
