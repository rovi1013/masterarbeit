Climate Glossary

Greenhouse gases (GHG):
Gases that absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, warming the atmosphere. Key examples are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O).

CO2 equivalent (CO2e):
A common unit to compare the climate impact of different greenhouse gases by converting them to the amount of CO2 with the same warming effect.

Mitigation:
Actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or enhance carbon sinks. Examples include renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency.

Adaptation:
Actions that reduce the negative impacts of climate change. Examples include flood protection and heat-resilient infrastructure.
